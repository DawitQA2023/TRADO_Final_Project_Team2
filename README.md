### 🔑 KEYWORDS:

>* Python = is a popular programming language.
>* Pytest = is a command-line tool that automatically finds tests you've written, runs the tests, and reports the results.
>* Allure = is a flexible lightweight multi-language test report tool that not only shows a very concise representation of what have been tested in a neat web report form, but allows everyone participating in the development process to extract maximum of useful information from everyday execution of tests.
>* Selenium = is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and performing browser automation.
>* API =  is an abbreviation for Application Programming Interface which is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them.
>* POM (Page Object Model) = is a design pattern which is commonly used in Selenium for Automating the Test Cases. This design pattern can be used with any kind of framework like keyword-driven, Data-driven, hybrid framework, etc.
>* __init__.py file = is a file that is used to mark a directory as a Python package. Every directory that contains code that you want to be able to import as a simple Python package needs to contain an __init__.py. 
>* allure.severity = In allure, we can define any @Test with @Severity annotation with any of these values like BLOCKER, CRITICAL, NORMAL, MINOR, TRIVIAL. By looking at this, we can understand the Severity of test if Failed.
>* allure.description = are detailed description for each test method.
>* allure.attach = An attachment in Java code is simply a method annotated with @Attachment that returns either a String or byte[], which should be added to the report.
>* allure.step = are any actions that constitute a testing scenario. Steps can be used in different testing scenarios.
>* pytest.mark = are used to set various features/attributes to test functions.
>* pytest.fixture = are functions that can be used to manage our apps states and dependencies.
>* Assertion = are statements that you can use to set sanity checks during the development process.
>* Window alert = it instructs the browser to display a dialog with an optional message, and to wait until the user dismisses the dialog.
>* Time.sleep = is used to add delay in the execution of a program.
>* implicitly_wait = sets a sticky timeout to implicitly wait for an element to be found, or a command to complete.
>* execute_script = The commands to be executed are passed as arguments to the method. Some operations like scrolling down in a page cannot be performed by Selenium methods directly
>* Jenkins = is an open source automation server which enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.




## 🚧 About The project
>* The Name of the project is
>* >     TRADO FINAL PROJECT TEAM 2
>* This project is Build in Python programming language using POM and have Multiple class and directory's. 
>* 
>* > ABOUT "TRADO"
   >-- We believe performance needs to be validated at every stage of the software development cycle and our open source compatible, massively scalable platform makes that a reality.
>* This project we have two websites those are QA TRADO and QA Admin.  
>* As we can see there are many shortcomings in the E-commerce activity, which increases the cost per end-product for 
>* the end-retailer. Therefor TRADO provides a solution for all limitations, in a sale price aspect, price for shipping
>* and financing of the transaction.
>* When we open the browser and search QA Trado website then the QA Trado.
>* we get two options, the first cocktail and the second restaurant after that Save.
>* when click the save button we get the QA Trado home page . if we want to use this website we should be sign up  
>* To create account, we should be connected mongodb with phone number than accept verification code,after that insert code then sign up.
>* When we use the QA Admin open browser we should Enter phone number and password then we have two options those are Daniel and Trado 
>* pages we select Trado pages.
>* This website has 5 component which needed to be checked these are (Dashboard,products,Orders,payments and users categories).
>
>* We created Three main directories for both QA and Admin part of the website
>* ADMIN_WEB, QA_WEB, AND SERVER DIRECTORY
>*  For each directory has sub-categories (Bases, Locators, Pages, Tests, Utilities)
>* Base test --  It contains - a written code which can be used for every time (commen functions)
>* Locators  -- It contains the path for each element in the  website
>* Pages  -- Inside the page there is pre-requirement page which is used to as a fixture 
>* Utilities --- This directory contains The assertion methods 
>* Tests  ----  This directory contains  test running codes 
>*  Server connection to mongodb

## ⚙ Usage
* Open Pycharm Community Edition 
* Open Pycharm terminal
* Navigate the absolute value of the tests
* Run tests in a module using pytest test_mod.py.
* To enable Allure listener to collect results during the test execution simply add --alluredir option and provide path to the folder where results should be stored. 
* > E.g.: pytest --alluredir=/tmp/my_allure_results
* To see the actual report after your tests have finished, you need to use Allure commandline utility to generate report from the results.
* > E.g.: allure serve /tmp/my_allure_results
